# Information about my samples
## Sample collection  
I sequenced a total of 300 Atlantic cod samples. Within these 300 samples, I had 160 samples that came from populations around Iceland and 140 samples from the Gulf of Maine:  

#### **Iceland Samples:** 
40 - Pop 1  Southwest Offshore  
40 - Pop 2  Southwest Nearshore  
40 - Pop 3  Northeast Offshore  
40 - Pop 4  Northeast Nearshore  

#### **Gulf of Maine Samples:**
35 - Pop 5  Massachusetts Bay Red Cod  
18 - Pop 6  Massachusetts Bay (putatively) Olive Spring Cod  
37 - Pop 7  Massachusetts Bay Olive Winter Cod   
25 - Pop 8  Cashes Ledge Red Cod   
25 - Pop 9  Cashes Ledge Olive Cod   

The goal of our study is to identify whether red and olive cod represent a similar ecotype that has been described in other populations including Iceland, frontal (offshore migratory cod) and coastal (nearshore stationary cod). We aimed to evaluate the genomic basis for differentiation within these two populations. 

### **Sample prep**

Fin clips from samples were extracted using E.Z. 96 Tissue DNA Kits (SKU: D1196-01).

Extracted samples were mechanically sheared using a Covaris ME220 sonicator to 300 bp.

Libraries of each sample were made using half reactions of the KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Material Number: 7962363001). We used custom primers with unique indexes on both the i5 and i7 primers and custom adaptors with unique barcodes in order to multiplex all 300 samples.

Librarys were quantified on an AriaMx Realtime qPCR machine using KAPA Library Quantification Kit - Illumina (Cat: KK4824). Using the qPCR quantifications, samples were combined for sequencing in equimolar ratios.

We sequenced the final pool of samples using paired end 2x150 bp sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq S4 flow cell to an average coverage of 15x.
